## Tech Stack

The Ebook Store is developed using the following technologies:

- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making the application more efficient and maintainable.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed components and styles. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid development and customization of the application's appearance.

- **Hooks (useState, useEffect, Context API):** React Hooks provide a way to use stateful logic in functional components, enabling better code organization and reusability. The useState hook is used for managing state, useEffect for handling side effects, and Context API for managing global state across components.

- **Figma to React Implementation:** The UI and design of the Ebook Store were first created in Figma, a popular design tool. The Figma design was then translated into React components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface.
